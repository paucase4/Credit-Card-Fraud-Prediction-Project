# Evaluation of Supervised Learning Models for Credit Card Fraud Prediction
##  Author: Pau CasÃ© - October 2025

# ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project evaluates the performance of multiple supervised learning algorithms for credit card fraud detection using real-world data. Multiple tests were run with different hyperparameters.
The main objective is to compare models in terms of accuracy and PRAUC with a special focus on handling class imbalance.
It uses the Kaggle dataset from UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Models evaluated
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Metrics Used
- Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (main)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
Among all tested models, the Decision Tree achieved the highest balance between recall and precision, indicating strong performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
